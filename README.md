# 1Win Aviator: The Complete Guide for Indian Players

## What is Aviator?

Aviator is a crash game that is played online. The game is simple to
play: players bet on how long a plane will stay in the air before
crashing. If the plane crashes before the player cashes out, they lose
their bet. If the plane stays in the air for longer than the player
cashed out, they win their bet multiplied by the multiplier that the
plane reached.
